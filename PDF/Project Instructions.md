# Project Instructions

## **Short Scientific Paper: “AI Bubble”**

## 1. Project Overview

The objective of this project is to produce a **short, systematic scientific paper** that critically examines the concept of the **“AI Bubble”**—the hypothesis that current investment, valuation, and expectations surrounding Artificial Intelligence may be unsustainably inflated relative to its real economic and technological output.

Students are expected to apply **analytical reasoning**, **economic literacy**, and **technical understanding of AI systems**, while adhering strictly to academic writing standards.

## 2. Learning Objectives

Upon successful completion of this project, students should demonstrate the ability to:

* Analyze technological hype cycles using formal economic and technological frameworks
* Distinguish **measurable AI capabilities** from speculative or promotional narratives
* Apply **evidence-based reasoning** using credible institutional sources
* Communicate complex interdisciplinary topics in a **clear, structured, and scientific manner**

## 3. Scope and Focus

### The paper must focus on:

* Artificial Intelligence as a **technological and economic phenomenon**
* Investment behavior, valuation trends, and market expectations
* The gap between **AI promises** and **deployable, productive systems**

### The paper must NOT:

* Be a journalistic opinion piece
* Rely on social media, blogs, or speculative commentary
* Advocate extreme positions without empirical support

## 4. Required Paper Structure

The paper must strictly follow the structure below.
