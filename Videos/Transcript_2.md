# AI bubble madness: Why the stock market fell $2,000,000,000,000 in just FIVE HOURS

## AI bubble & Nvidia

The US stock market is in the largest bubble in history, and that bubble is being driven by the development of artificial intelligence technology, AI. Were it not for this bubble, it's likely that the US economy would be in recession.

Yet, most of the US big tech corporations developing AI are not actually making money on AI. There's really only one company that's making a lot of money on AI, and that is Nvidia. And that's because Nvidia has a global monopoly, at least for right now, on the design of the most advanced chips, GPUs, that are used to develop AI.

And Nvidia's founder and CEO, Jensen Huang, has become a celebrity who's constantly celebrated in the financial press and portrayed as this great visionary, with memes even saying, not so jokingly, that Nvidia is holding up the entire US economy or the global economy on its shoulders. This is how Nvidia became the most valuable company on Earth. It was the first ever company to have a market capitalization of more than $4 trillion.

But as I'll show today, Nvidia's stock has been very volatile, and there have been crazy swings of hundreds of billions of dollars, with a B, hundreds of billions of dollars in rises and falls in just a few hours, with this crazy mania going on in the US stock market, which demonstrates how dangerous this bubble is and how it's not actually based on fundamentals.

It's based on risky speculation and really gambling for a lot of so-called investors. They're really just gambling, thinking the number always will go up, the line must go up forever. But the problem with this is that all bubbles eventually pop. That's why they're called bubbles.

And Nvidia can only continue to make all of this money because other big tech companies are losing money buying chips from Nvidia in order to develop AI. And eventually, when the bubble pops, Nvidia will lose its customers and the entire scheme will collapse. And everyone knows this. The question is simply how long can the bubble continue to inflate?

I mean, the fact that it's even a bubble is not controversial. Even the CEO of OpenAI, the leading US AI company, Sam Altman, has admitted that AI is in a bubble.

## Magnificent Seven (Mag7) Big Tech stocks

So much of the US economy depends on capital expenditure by just seven big tech corporations known as the Magnificent 7, or the Mag 7. These are Amazon, Apple, Google or Alphabet, Meta, which owns Facebook, Microsoft, Nvidia, and Tesla.

Together, these seven companies have a larger market capitalization than the entire stock market in all of Europe or in China, which has 1.4 billion people and is the largest economy in the world when you measure China’s GDP at purchasing power parity.

In fact, as of the 17th of November 2025, the Magnificent Seven big tech corporations made up more than one third of the S&P 500. That is the main US stock market index, which includes the 500 largest publicly listed companies. Thirty-five percent of the S&P 500 is made up by just the Mag 7, and that figure has been growing in the past few years as this insane bubble has been inflating.

Now, when people post memes on social media saying that the entire US economy depends on this AI bubble continuing to inflate and on companies like Nvidia, it is basically the truth.

## US GDP growth depends on AI capex

A Harvard University economist named Jason Furman, who was the top economic adviser to US President Barack Obama, found that investment in information processing equipment and software, which is largely AI capital expenditure, made up 92% of US GDP growth in the first half of 2025.

And were it not for all of that spending, primarily in AI capex, US GDP growth in the first half of the year would have been 0.1%. Complete stagnation.

This is why the AI bubble is such an important issue. Because were it not for this bubble, the US economy could very well be in a crisis right now, which is why the US government has been pouring resources into supporting these big tech corporations in Silicon Valley to prevent this unsustainable bubble from popping.

## AI circular financing scheme

Which means that we see more and more crazy things happening, like a circular financing scheme in which big tech companies are all investing in each other to make it look like everyone is making money. But in reality, the same money is just circulating, going through these different companies, giving IOUs, promising that in the future they will pay the other company, but they have not done so yet.

The best example of this is OpenAI. OpenAI is not making money. It is actually losing a lot of money. Basically, Nvidia is the only major company that is actually making money on AI. Of course, big tech companies like Microsoft and Google are making a lot of money from other services and products, but not from their actual AI research and their large language models.

So what is happening is that Nvidia is making all of this money from these big tech companies that are buying chips from Nvidia. Nvidia is then using some of that money, first of all, to buy back its own shares to continue inflating the bubble. And Nvidia is also investing in other companies like OpenAI, which is one of its main customers.

One of the big criticisms of this circular financing scheme is that a lot of people are concerned that what Nvidia is doing is trying to prop up its customers who are hemorrhaging money, and that their purchases of Nvidia chips are not sustainable in the medium to the long term.

## OpenAI is losing money, but owes $1.4 trillion

Again, the case study of this is OpenAI. Now, OpenAI is not a publicly listed company, so it does not disclose the same information as other publicly traded companies. However, even though OpenAI is private, one of its biggest investors is Microsoft, and Microsoft is a publicly listed company.

So Microsoft has revealed that in just one quarter, OpenAI lost $12 billion. However, while OpenAI is hemorrhaging money and is very far from being profitable, it owes $1.4 trillion in commitments it has made to other companies for chips from Nvidia and for data centers, which are being built out by companies like Oracle.

OpenAI does not actually have the money it needs to pay these other companies. Sam Altman, the CEO, claims that in a few years OpenAI will magically become profitable. But a lot of people are looking at the data and saying, “These numbers don’t add up, and eventually this scheme will fall apart and the bubble will burst.”

## Nvidia profits rise in earnings report

This is where Nvidia comes in. Again, I’ll go back to this meme. And as I said earlier, it’s not that much of a joke to say that the US economy is being held up by this crazy bubble being driven largely by Nvidia. Because as I’ve repeated here, Nvidia is really the only major company involved in AI that’s actually making money.

That’s because Nvidia is selling the shovels in the new digital gold rush to the other AI companies that are losing money on developing large language models, LLMs, but they’re buying chips from Nvidia. And this is why people are so closely following what’s happening at Nvidia.

And this is why, on the 19th of November, Nvidia released its earnings report for the third fiscal quarter. And it looked like it was a great report, at least superficially. Financial media outlets like the Wall Street Journal announced that Nvidia’s profits were soaring, soothing investor jitters over the AI boom, or the AI bubble more specifically.

In fact, when he announced this new earnings report, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang criticized people who say that AI is in a big speculative bubble, and he said, “We see something very different,” essentially arguing that it’s not actually a bubble.

Here’s how Fortune magazine reported it. They said, “Jensen Huang pours cold water on an AI bubble and says Nvidia is unlike any other accelerator in the boom.” And yeah, maybe it is unlike any other accelerator, but that’s pretty easy to say when all of the other companies are losing money and you’re one of the very few that’s actually making money. Then it can seem like things are much rosier than they actually are, at least on the surface.

## US investor madness

And this apparently super strong Nvidia earnings report led to some really crazy, unhinged responses on finance Twitter. And a US investor was ratioed after she boldly stated that she was raising her 2030 target on Nvidia’s market cap from $10 trillion to $20 trillion.

This is not satire. I saw a lot of people joking about this on Twitter. I at first thought it was a joke, but no. This is a serious investor in the US, a finance industry professional, claiming that she has all the data and she can confidently show that by 2030, in just five years, Nvidia’s market cap will quintuple. It is currently $4 trillion, which is already insane. It is the most valuable company on Earth. She’s claiming that it will quintuple in five years to $20 trillion.

Now for context here, the IMF projects that the GDP of the United States will be $36.8 trillion in 2030. That is the value of all of the goods and services produced in the entire US economy with more than 340 million people, while some US financial analysts are claiming that Nvidia’s market cap will be $20 trillion at the same time.

Now, I will add a quick note here acknowledging that some economists don’t like to compare GDP to the market cap of companies because they point out correctly that GDP is a flow. It’s not like the US has $37 trillion just sitting around that it’s going to use. GDP is a flow of goods and services over a period of time, whereas market capitalization, or wealth, is a stock. And the economist Michal Kalecki famously joked that economics is the science of confusing stocks with flows.

So I don’t want to be accused of confusing stocks and flows here, but I just want to illustrate how insane this AI bubble is and how otherwise very smart people are just losing their minds and thinking that the number will always go up. The line always goes up. It can never go down. And Nvidia can never lose money. It’s going to continue growing at breakneck speed as we move into artificial general intelligence, AGI, and the machines take over and we live in a utopia.

I mean, this is complete nonsense, but this is the narrative that’s driving a lot of opinion around AI.

## China challenges Nvidia's chip monopoly

And I have to add another detail here from a geopolitical perspective, and I think it's shocking that no one’s talking about this, which is the fact that China is currently pouring resources into challenging Nvidia’s monopoly. So the idea that Nvidia will always have this moat, as investors say, this dominant position, basically a monopoly where it’s the only company that can design the most advanced cutting-edge chips, GPUs for AI, that idea is absurd.

Because in the US there are companies already challenging Nvidia, like Google. And especially in China, the government has prioritized challenging US dominance in cutting-edge chips. And in China, it’s not just one company that’s challenging Nvidia.

Some people might know that Huawei, the major tech giant, is also developing cutting-edge chips and challenging Nvidia. But there are many other companies, Alibaba, Baidu, and a bunch of others that you’ve never heard of. They’re working in China right now as we speak to develop their own cutting-edge chips, GPUs for AI models, to take market share away from Nvidia.

So it’s completely absurd, this idea that Nvidia will always have a moat, will always have this monopolistic control, that the number will always go up, the line will always go up, and it will continue growing and becoming more and more valuable and eventually hit $20 trillion in market cap. It’s just completely insane. If you look rationally at what’s actually happening, if you ignore all of the buzz and the mania, it’s completely crazy.

## Crazy volatility in Nvidia stock

And this is why we see these absolutely crazy movements in the US stock market, especially when looking at Nvidia’s stock. This is why Nvidia has been breaking records with massive rises and then even bigger falls.

So right after Nvidia announced its earnings report for the third fiscal quarter, in just a few hours its market cap shot up by $450 billion. And then several hours later, over a period of just one day, its market cap fell by $600 billion.

We’re talking about such insane amounts of money that it just blows your mind. A $600 billion fall in market cap in one day. This is why the very popular financial newsletter, the Kobeissi Letter, referred to this as absolute insanity.

It pointed out that there was a swing of over $1 trillion of market cap over 54 hours. That is $19 billion per hour in movement. And they correctly pointed out that these are not fundamental price moves. That is to say, this is not sound investment based on the fundamentals of the company.

This is sentiment-based, which is a nice roundabout way of saying this is crazy speculative mania. This is the behavior of a bubble.

## CEO Jensen Huang's private comments

And it’s very instructive to compare what Nvidia is saying publicly to what it’s saying privately. I mentioned earlier that Nvidia’s CEO Jensen Huang publicly criticized the bears who said that there’s an AI bubble, and he said, “We don’t see an AI bubble.”

But in private, Jensen Huang is actually much more sober about the situation. And we know this because the financial press leaked an audio recording of an internal meeting inside Nvidia in which the CEO acknowledged that most people have concluded that this is a bubble. He complained that Nvidia is in a no-win situation, a lose-lose situation, because people are getting really afraid about what’s happening with these crazy movements in the stock market.

Huang said, quote, “If we delivered a bad quarter, it is evidence there’s an AI bubble. If we delivered a great quarter, we are fueling the AI bubble.” End quote. And, to be fair to him, he’s actually right.

And it’s not just Nvidia’s fault that there’s this massive bubble. But it is in Nvidia’s economic interest to continue inflating that bubble and to pretend like there is no bubble, like nothing’s happening, which is very risky and very dangerous. And that’s what they’re doing to benefit their own bottom line, which is doing damage to the rest of the economy and the world, which is very irresponsible.

So again, it’s not just Nvidia’s fault that there’s this big bubble, but we shouldn’t pretend like they’re some innocent victim in all of this. And if for some reason you’re sympathetic to Jensen Huang, when you read about other comments that he made, you should not be sympathetic.

Because in this audio recording, this leaked recording of the internal meeting at Nvidia, Huang not so jokingly referenced the memes that said that Nvidia is holding up the planet. And this is what he said. Quote, “We’re basically holding the planet together and it’s not untrue.” End quote. So he’s saying they are holding up the planet.

## $600 billion drop in one day

Huang also joked about how Nvidia’s market cap fell by $500 billion, referencing the fact that briefly, due to this speculative mania, Nvidia’s market cap reached a peak of $5 trillion and then fell back down to around $4.5 trillion.

And he said, quote, “Nobody in history has ever lost $500 billion in a few weeks. You’ve got to be worth a lot to lose $500 billion in a few weeks.” End quote.

But the point that I’m trying to emphasize here is that we’re not just talking about a few weeks. We’re talking about a fall in Nvidia’s market cap of $600 billion in one day. This is how absolutely crazy this mania is and how it’s actually accelerating. It’s picking up steam.

Previously, Nvidia’s market cap fell by $500 billion in a few weeks. Now the speculation and mania are so crazy that it fell by $600 billion in one day.

## Four customers make up 61% of Nvidia revenue

And when you look closer at the data, it makes sense why investors are getting scared about Nvidia and this bubble. Because I mentioned that Nvidia had this great earnings report and the financial press celebrated it for having great earnings and everything looked like it was great. But then financial analysts pointed out there were some serious issues.

First of all, there’s the fact that just four customers make up 61% of Nvidia’s revenue. Now, those customers were left anonymous. We don’t know exactly who they are, but customer A makes up 22% of Nvidia’s revenue, nearly one quarter. Customer B makes up 15%, customer C 13%, and customer D 11%. Together, four customers represent 61% of Nvidia’s revenue in the third quarter of the fiscal year 2025–2026.

Again, those customers were not named, but we basically know who they are. They are big tech corporations in Silicon Valley like Meta, like Google or its parent company Alphabet, like OpenAI, like potentially xAI or Tesla, Elon Musk’s companies, or other potential candidates like Oracle. These hyperscalers, these companies that are building out the big data centers, these enormous AI data centers, are spending billions of dollars per quarter, tens of billions of dollars per year, buying chips from Nvidia.

And if those companies stop buying chips, if they realize they’re not going to make any money on AI because they’re all losing money, especially OpenAI as I talked about earlier, and they have to start cutting back their capital expenditure and stop buying chips from Nvidia, what’s going to happen to Nvidia’s revenue? It’s going to plummet. What’s going to happen to Nvidia’s net income, which we popularly call its profits? Its profits are going to fall through the floor.

So that was the first red flag of Nvidia’s earnings report, and it was a massive red flag. But there were others that were also discovered by financial analysts.

## IOUs: Nvidia’s accounts receivable rises

Others pointed out, for instance, that if you look closely at Nvidia’s earnings report, you can see that its accounts receivable has been increasing significantly. What does that mean for people who don’t know how to read a balance sheet?

This line item refers to sales done by a company to its customers that were paid on credit. So when Nvidia sells chips to OpenAI and OpenAI is losing money, they don’t have the money to actually pay Nvidia. So what Nvidia says is, okay, we will sell these chips to you on credit and in the future you can pay us.

But again, OpenAI doesn’t actually have the money to pay Nvidia, at least right now. So maybe OpenAI will take on more debt. They’ll convince investors to give them more money, although more and more investors are actually not convinced and are becoming skeptical, realizing that OpenAI probably will never be able to pay off all of its existing obligations, let alone new ones.

So as the accounts receivable line item on Nvidia’s balance sheet continues to grow more and more, a lot of people are asking questions, saying, “Wait a second, do Nvidia’s customers actually have the money to pay Nvidia for the chips that they’re buying on credit?” This is another significant red flag.

## GPU demand? Nvidia inventories surge

And then a third red flag that financial analysts pointed out was another line item on Nvidia’s earnings report, which was inventories. This refers to all of the products that Nvidia has that have not yet been sold.

So we’re constantly told that there’s so much demand for Nvidia’s chips and companies are just going to buy more and more GPUs to build AI data centers and develop AI. And yet Nvidia’s inventory is skyrocketing. It’s now $20 billion as of the third quarter of fiscal year 2025–2026.

So this raises another question. If there truly is insatiable demand for Nvidia’s chips coming from these AI companies, why do the inventories keep rising so much? Especially in 2025, the inventories have tripled in one year.

## S&P 500 falls $2 trillion in 5 hours

All of this very important information explains why Nvidia stock has been so volatile and why there have been these crazy swings. Because again, on the 19th of November, Nvidia published its earnings report and said, “We’re the greatest company ever. There’s no bubble. Look how great we are.” And investors celebrated, and immediately its market cap went up by $450 billion in a few hours.

But then the next day, as financial analysts, bears, and skeptics pointed out some of these very important red flags, suddenly investors got really scared and started selling off Nvidia stock, and the market cap fell by $600 billion in one day.

And at the same time, investors started selling off other stocks, especially big tech stocks. And the market cap of the S&P 500 fell by $2 trillion in five hours as fear began to spread across the market.

We saw Oracle stock fall by 44% from its record high, Palantir stock fall by 30%, Meta’s by 27%, AMD’s by 27%, and Tesla’s by 22%.

Now, yes, it is true that some people bought the dip and the S&P did recover after falling a bit. But still, this was the most significant reversal in the US stock market since Trump’s so-called liberation day in April, when he announced tariffs on countries all around the world, which also caused fear and a crazy sell-off in the US stock market.

## US economy built on financial house of cards

What all this demonstrates is how the US economy is built on this crazy financial house of cards in the stock market, the biggest bubble ever. And in just a few hours, investors can get really scared and sell off trillions of dollars’ worth of stocks. And then the next day, suddenly everything will recover and it will be as if nothing happened. This is not how you should actually be running your economy.

The crazy, financialized casino of the US economy is extremely dangerous. This is why even mainstream financial media outlets like *Fortune* magazine are warning publicly and loudly that the stock market is barreling toward a “show me the money” moment for AI and a possible global crash.

And that’s what’s so frustrating about all of this. Sometimes it’s fun to make fun of these rich investors and oligarchs who are so out of touch with reality and think that in a few months we’ll have AGI and we’ll all live in some crazy utopia, not mentioning, of course, that they will own all of the AI technology. It’s their intellectual property, and so many people will lose their jobs, be unemployed, and fall into poverty, and they won’t actually have any money to buy the goods and services of these big tech oligarchs. They don’t mention that part. That’s an issue for another day.

But again, the point is that so much of not just the US economy, but the global economy, which has been deeply financialized in the neoliberal era with the deregulation of financial markets and capital markets in the 1980s and 1990s, not only in the US but in many countries around the world, depends on these massive bubbles continuing to be inflated.

These bubbles are in the US stock market, in crypto, in the US real estate market, in private credit, and in private equity. These bubbles are all unsustainable and they’re very dangerous. And when they pop, as every bubble does, it will be catastrophic.

## Markets can remain irrational...

But I do have to add, with all of that said, that the bubble can continue to inflate. Oftentimes, bubbles continue to get crazier and crazier even though everyone knows there’s a bubble. This is certainly what happened with the dot-com bubble that popped back in 2000. And this goes back not just decades but centuries.

The renowned economist John Maynard Keynes, one of the most important economists in world history, famously quipped that markets can remain irrational longer than you can remain solvent. So no one really knows when the AI bubble will pop. But again, I say with certainty that all bubbles in history have eventually popped at some moment, and this bubble will pop as well.

## Dangers of a recession or depression

But what I’m really concerned about is that when that bubble pops, it could cause a serious recession or even a full-on depression. Just like how there was nonstop propaganda in the media in the 1920s in the United States claiming that it was the golden age, that the stock market was booming and everyone would get rich, even though the vast majority of people did not actually own stocks. They said the party would never end. This was the era of *The Great Gatsby*.

The number can only go up. The line always goes up. And then what happened in 1929? The bubble burst. It contributed significantly to the Great Depression in the 1930s, which led to the disaster of World War II. And we all know the horrors people suffered in the 1930s and 1940s.

So that’s why I’m so concerned about the AI bubble and the enormous stock market bubble in the US, which is the largest bubble in the history of the US stock market. And this is why we here at *Geopolitical Economy Report* will always analyze these important issues to help you understand what’s going on today in geopolitics and the economy, and how it affects your life.
