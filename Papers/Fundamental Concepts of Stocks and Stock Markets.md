## 2. Stocks: Definition and Properties

### 2.1 Definition

A **stock (equity security)** represents a proportional ownership claim in a corporation, typically conferring:

* Residual claim on assets and earnings
* Voting rights (for common stock)
* Eligibility for dividends (if declared)

### 2.2 Stock Types

| Stock Type      | Key Characteristics                                        |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| Common Stock    | Voting rights, variable dividends, higher risk             |
| Preferred Stock | Fixed dividends, no voting rights, priority in liquidation |
| Growth Stock    | Earnings reinvestment, minimal dividends                   |
| Value Stock     | Lower valuation multiples, stable cash flows               |

## 3. Stock Market vs. Stock Exchange

### 3.1 Stock Market

The **stock market** is a macro-level system encompassing:

* All stock exchanges
* Broker-dealers
* Clearing and settlement systems
* Over-the-counter (OTC) trading venues

It represents the aggregate trading environment within a country or globally.

### 3.2 Stock Exchange

A **stock exchange** is a regulated trading platform that provides:

* Order matching infrastructure
* Listing standards
* Price discovery mechanisms
* Market surveillance and compliance

Examples include **New York Stock Exchange** and **Nasdaq**.

## 4. Trading Infrastructure

### 4.1 Physical vs. Electronic Trading

* Historically, exchanges used **open outcry** systems.
* Modern trading is predominantly **electronic**, using automated limit-order books.
* Some exchanges maintain physical floors for ceremonial or specialized functions.

### 4.2 Hybrid Models

Certain venues combine:

* High-frequency electronic execution
* Human oversight for complex instruments (e.g., options)

## 5. Stock Market Indexes

### 5.1 Definition

A **stock market index** is a statistical measure tracking the performance of a defined basket of stocks. Indexes are not directly investable but serve as benchmarks for funds and portfolios.

### 5.2 Index Construction Methods

| Method              | Description                           |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Market-cap weighted | Weight proportional to company size   |
| Price-weighted      | Weight proportional to share price    |
| Equal-weighted      | Identical weight for all constituents |

These reflect the performance of companies listed on a single exchange.

* **Nasdaq Composite**
* **Nikkei 225**
* **FTSE 100**

### 6.2 Cross-Exchange Indexes

These span multiple exchanges within a market.

* **S&P 500** – 500 largest US firms
* **Dow Jones Industrial Average** – 30 blue-chip companies
